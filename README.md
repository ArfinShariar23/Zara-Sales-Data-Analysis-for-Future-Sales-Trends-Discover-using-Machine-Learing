# 🛍️ Zara-Sales-Data-Analysis-for-Future-Sales-Trends-Discover-using-Machine-Learing
📄 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Zara’s sales data to uncover key business insights and predict future sales trends using machine learning techniques.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling, the project identifies the most influential factors affecting sales performance — such as price, category, and seasonality — and builds models to forecast future sales volumes.
The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven decision-making can help fashion retailers like Zara optimize inventory planning, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.

🎯 Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand Zara’s sales patterns and trends.

Preprocess and engineer data for machine learning-based prediction.

Build and evaluate ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for future sales forecasting.

Visualize insights using graphs and plots to highlight relationships among product features, sales, and seasonality.

Provide actionable insights for inventory optimization and sales strategy enhancement.


⚙️ Methodology

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifying sales trends, price distributions, and category performance.

Feature Engineering: Adding new attributes and normalizing features for model readiness.

Model Development: Implementing and evaluating ML algorithms for predicting sales volumes.

Visualization: Creating graphs to illustrate insights and model performance.

📊 Results

Seasonality is a major driver of Zara’s sales, especially during Autumn and Winter.

Random Forest Regressor provided the most accurate predictions among tested models.

Affordable outerwear and accessories dominate the sales volume.

The model successfully forecasts future sales trends, supporting better decision-making.
